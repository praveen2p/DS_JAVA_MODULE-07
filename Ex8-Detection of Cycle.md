# Ex8 Detection of Cycle and Finding the Starting Node in a Linked List
## DATE:
## AIM:
To write a program that detects a cycle in a linked list and returns the node where the cycle begins.
If there is no cycle, the program should return null without modifying the linked list.
## Algorithm
```

1. Start
2. Read the number of nodes n
3. Initialize head as null
4. Repeat n times:
   a) Read a data value
   b) Create a new node with this data
   c) Insert the new node at the end of the linked list
5. Read an integer pos (position to connect tail to, -1 means no cycle)
6. If pos is not -1:
   a) Traverse the list to find the tail node
   b) Traverse the list to find the node at index pos
   c) Set tail.next to that node to create a cycle
7. To detect the cycle, set slow = head and fast = head
8. While fast is not null and fast.next is not null:
   a) Move slow one step forward
   b) Move fast two steps forward
   c) If slow and fast point to the same node, a cycle is detected; go to step 9
9. To find the start of the cycle:
   a) Set p1 = head and p2 = slow
   b) While p1 is not equal to p2:
        i) Move p1 one step forward
       ii) Move p2 one step forward
   c) The node where p1 and p2 meet is the start of the cycle
10. If a cycle was found, print the data value of the start node
11. If no cycle was found, print null
12. End
```

## Result:
The program successfully detects whether a cycle exists in the linked list.
If a cycle is present, it correctly identifies and returns the node where the cycle begins.
